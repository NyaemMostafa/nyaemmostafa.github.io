        <p>My journey in medical device engineering</p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-content">
        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Robotics at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, with an expected graduation in May 2027. My academic journey is driven by a singular focus: <strong>bridging engineering innovation with tangible healthcare outcomes</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>My interest in medical devices began during my Mentoring in Medicine internship, where I saw firsthand how engineering principles could directly impact patient care. This experience solidified my passion for creating technologies that assist both patients and physicians.</p>
            
            <h2>Engineering Philosophy</h2>
            <p>I believe the most impactful medical devices emerge from three key principles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clinical Relevance:</strong> Every design decision should be informed by real clinical needs and constraints</li>
                <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Medical technology should be both effective and economically viable</li>
                <li><strong>Human-Centered Design:</strong> Devices must prioritize patient comfort and physician usability</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>This philosophy guides my work in the Flexible AI-Enabled Mechatronics Systems Laboratory, where I'm developing next-generation robotic endoscopes, and in my leadership of the NYU Tandon MedTech Club, where I connect engineering students with medical professionals.</p>
            
            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>I plan to pursue a Master's Degree in Biomedical Engineering to deepen my understanding of clinical design constraints and regulatory pathways. My ultimate goal is to contribute to the development of minimally invasive surgical systems that improve patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.</p>
