        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Robotics at NYU Tandon School of Engineering, with an expected graduation in May 2027. After I graduate, I'd like to enter industry or graduate school, where I can learn and gain first-hand experience in designing and assembling projects within the medical device and medical robotics industry.>
            
            <p>My interest in medical devices was first an interest in becoming a doctor. During my last year of high school, I realized that I could enter the medical field without having to be a doctor. Being an engineer that makes the tools in a clinical environment was a very interesting pathway that I wanted to explore.</p>
